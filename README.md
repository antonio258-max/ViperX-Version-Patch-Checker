# ViperX-Version-Patch-Checker
ViperX Version and Patch management.

This repository is only used to see if your ViperX Exploit that you have installed is the latest version.

• "VersionCheck" is used to verify the version of your exploit, to avoid inconvenience and bad times.

• "PatchCheck" is used to see if the exploit is patched, this will be used when the creator (me) decides to close this project (ViperX).

• "License" I only put it to make it look more cool, but I have no problem that you use this repository for your purposes :D.

Thanks for read.
